# mpv-shaders
Just a couple of shaders for mpv either created fresh or converted from diffent sources. Mostly utilized claude to create these. I don't have any knowledge of shader creation and these are some of my successful experimentations I did just for fun, so the code might be crap. Feel free to implement any optimizations but really don't have any idea on how these shaders work.

Just an initial commit, will soon be uploading the shaders.
